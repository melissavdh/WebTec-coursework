<p>Features constant throughout site:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Header:</strong> I used the header template as described in the lecture 
  notes, changing the height and colour to suit my design.  I have added a navigation 
  bar, using an unordered list with each list item displayed inline, and text-decoration 
  set to none to remove the bullet points.  I used a basic template from w3schools 
  (http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_navbar_horizontal) and 
  amended it for my purposes.  The main aspects of my havigation bar are:
  <ul>
    <li>The link to the page the user is currently on is changed into text rather than 
    a clickable link.</li>
    <li>The link/text to the current page has a rounded-corner box behind it of 
    the same colour as the body background rather than the header background.  
    I used the example given at (http://www.css3.info/preview/rounded-border/) to 
    implement this correctly.IE</li>
    <li>When a user hovers over a possible link they can click on, the same 
    rounded-corner box appears behind it as the box around the current page.</li>
    <li>The links in the navigation bar remain identically positioned throughout 
    the site.</li>
    <li>The "Email Us" link automatically opens the user's default mail client 
    if they have mail installed, creates a draft email to owners@riadestelle.com 
    with the subject "Riad Estelle".</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Footer:</strong> same colour and dimensions as the header.  I have 
  added a copyright to it, centrally aligned.</li>
  <li><strong>Formatting:</strong> the header, footer, background, header, and text 
  colours are consistent throughout the site.  They all use the same corresponding 
  div in the css file - I have not defined more than one for different pages.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Homepage:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Heading:</strong> I have two headings, one reading "marhaba" in Arabic 
  script, which is Moroccan for "Welcome", and the other saying "Welcome" below.  
  I have set the language of the Arabic text to be Arabic with the Moroccan dialect 
  using lang="ar-ary", so that if someone uses a screen reader or Braille device 
  then the Arabic will be pronounced properly.</li>
  <li><strong>Image gallery:</strong> I have created 3 images as links to parts of 
  the site.  When the user hovers over an image, the opacity is reduced to 50%.  
  I have used display:inline-block to position them centrally on the page in a row.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Rooms:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Links:</strong> The links are displayed as ordinay text in an 
  unordered list, except that when the mouse hovers over one of the links, it 
  is displayed with a rounded-corner box background of the same colour as the 
  header and footer.</li>
  <li><strong>Ground/First floor/Rooftop terrace:</strong> When a user clicks on 
  one of these links, they can go back to the Rooms page using the navigation bar 
  in the header.  The "Rooms" link in the header remains a link when the user has 
  used it to access another page and want to go back.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Prices:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Table:</strong> I have displayed the room prices for on and off peak 
  times of the year in a table, using the tutorial at http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_table.asp.</li>
  <li><strong>Bold text:</strong> I have used "strong" to put text in bold.</li>  
</ul>
</p>

<p>Marrakech:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Iframes:</strong> I have used two iframes to show previews of external 
  sites.  This allows a user to browse them without leaving my website.</li>
  <li><strong>Columns:</strong> I have arranged the page in a two-column layout, 
  allowing each iframe to take up half the page, and descriptive text below it 
  without having to interrupt the fuild layout.</li>  
</ul>
</p>

<p>Guestbook:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Comment form:</strong> I have used created a form for a user to 
  submit a review to the guestbook.  I have used the example at 
  http://www.w3schools.com/HTML/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_form_mail and changed 
  the values to fit with my site.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Site map:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Nested list:</strong>I have displayed the site map as one unordered 
  list nested with another, showing the structure of my site explicitly.  The nested 
  list uses a diferrent style of bullet to make it obvious.</li>
  <li><strong>Links:</strong>I have formatted the links as in the Rooms page, so 
  that they are formatted like ordinary text but gain a rounded-corner box when 
  hovered over.</li>  
</ul>
